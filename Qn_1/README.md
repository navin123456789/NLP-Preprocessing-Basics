# NLP Process
This project is a web app built with FastAPI, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate various NLP tasks such as Tokenization, Stemming, Embeddings, Named Entity Recognition, and POS Tagging. To use the app, clone the repository, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, navigate to the `app/` directory, and run the server using `uvicorn main:app`. Access the app at `http://localhost:8000` to input text and visualize NLP processes. Additionally, the repository includes code for training a Seq2Seq model on the CNN/DailyMail dataset using PyTorch, which can be customized for better results.
